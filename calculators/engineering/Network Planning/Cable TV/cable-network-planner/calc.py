=========================================================
Cable Network Planner v2 — closer-to-real design tool for cable-TV operators.

What this version models that v1 did NOT
----------------------------------------
1.  Road-following routes via OSRM (free) instead of straight lines.
    Falls back to Haversine if OSRM is unreachable.
2.  Terrain-adjusted cable length via Open-Elevation (free). A 100 m segment
    that climbs 30 m needs ~104 m of cable.
3.  Real RF attenuation: RG-11 hardline trunk @ 750 MHz design frequency.
    Amplifier inserted when cumulative loss exceeds a configurable budget
    (default 30 dB) — replaces v1's fixed-interval placement.
4.  Slope/difficulty grading per segment (easy / moderate / difficult /
    specialised) drives labour cost estimates.
5.  Bill of materials with per-currency cost estimates.

What this version STILL CANNOT do
---------------------------------
- Underground utility rights-of-way (needs paid data)
- Local installation codes (jurisdiction-specific, often paywalled)
- Building obstructions (needs 3D building data)
- RF interference (needs site survey with spectrum analyser)
- Soil/trenching conditions (needs geotechnical survey)

The disclaimer must remain in force. This tool produces a credible first-pass
design — not a final plan. Field verification by a licensed engineer is
still required before deployment.

            "The Cable Network Planner v2 is a free browser-based tool that "
            "helps cable-TV operators sketch a credible first-pass design "
            "for a coaxial distribution network. You define a service area "
            "(country, region, city, suburb), then drop a Headend Station "
            "and Consumer Nodes by clicking the map or typing street "
            "addresses.",

            "Behind the scenes the tool builds a fully-connected weighted "
            "graph and computes a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using "
            "Kruskal's algorithm — the shortest set of interconnections "
            "with no loops. For each MST edge it then asks OSRM (the free "
            "Open Source Routing Machine) for the actual driving route "
            "between the two points, replacing the straight-line distance "
            "with a road-following length much closer to the real cable "
            "run. If OSRM is unreachable the tool falls back to "
            "Haversine.",

            "Each route is then sampled for elevation using Open-Elevation "
            "(free SRTM-based service). Sampling ten points along the "
            "segment lets the tool compute the slope-adjusted cable "
            "length — the longer cable needed to follow undulating "
            "ground — and the maximum grade. Segments are flagged as "
            "easy, moderate, difficult, or specialised based on terrain.",

            "Amplifier placement is then computed from real RF physics. "
            "RG-11 hardline trunk attenuates roughly 6 dB per 100 m at "
            "750 MHz. The tool walks each segment metre by metre, "
            "tracking cumulative loss, and inserts an amplifier (line "
            "extender / bi-directional amp) wherever the cumulative loss "
            "exceeds the configurable budget (default 30 dB). This "
            "replaces fixed-interval placement with physics-based "
            "placement — amplifiers go where they're actually needed.",

            "Finally the bill of materials is computed in the currency you "
            "select. Cable, amplifiers, taps, connectors, power inserters, "
            "and labour are all priced — labour scales with terrain "
